  # GlassDeck is signed ad hoc rather than notarised, which needs a paid Apple
  # Developer account. Homebrew 6 removed the `--no-quarantine` install flag, so
  # the attribute is cleared here instead — the same step the release notes ask
  # people to run by hand. It is disclosed in the caveats below.

    <<~EOS
      GlassDeck is signed ad hoc rather than notarised, so this cask cleared the
      quarantine attribute on it during installation.

      GlassDeck has no Dock icon: look for the live meters in the menu bar.
